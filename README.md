As the world gets smarter, the rate of Cyber Attacks also increases. So, there is a large need for Cyber Attack Protection Systems. The devices such as mobile phones, laptops etc. sometimes show unusual behaviour so, to detect the cause of that unusual behaviour one need to install a cyber protection system. These types of systems are also helpful in understanding various different anomalies that occur in our devices. This type of system also protects various devices from hacking. These systems are also used to enhance Cyber Security.


MOTIVATION
Today's world of web connection, online fraud and cybercrime has increased, so there is the need for software which can prevent them. It is the main motivation behind the project. As cyber criminals are coming up with new methods of crime which are proving harder to be detected, so to make the project more robust and prevent it from becoming outdated, the team of authors chose the field of anomaly detection which is not based on some field pattern detection but uses AI to detect the fraud. With increase in usage of mobile phones, most of the frauds are now shifting towards them, so research members chose to develop the application for mobile phones.


ABSTRACT
Cyber Security has become a major concern in this digital era. Since, the cyber-attacks and their types are increasing at an immense rate, it is not humanly possible to monitor, identify and take actions against the attacks. With the current automation systems majorly relying on supervised learning algorithms where they have already seen the type of attacks to monitor and manage the attacks, these systems have been rendered inefficient by zero day attacks. 
It is essential that the research team start realising the immense potential of AI and utilise it to its full potential in the field of Cyber Security. If correctly applied, Artificial Intelligence can help to detect and deal with the cyber-attacks more efficiently and can help protect users that are not very security conscious and are not aware about the dangers of these security breaches. 
The authors have decided to utilise machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees and KDD(Knowledge Discovery In Database) to detect zero day attacks as well as handle other common Cyber-attacks, the authorsâ€™ team have designed an Artificial Intelligence based cybersecurity system that detects the attacks based on the anomalies rising in the network usage, port usage and packet analysis.
